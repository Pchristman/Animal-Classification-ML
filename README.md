This is an deep learning machine learning model trained on the Inception v3 classification algorithm. The goal of the model is to be able to identify and classify an image of an animal into one of ten classes that the model is trained on.

The .ipynb version of the code repository may not render the first time, however refreshing it seems to work for me. This is due to large amount of data graphics increasing the file size. This is also the reason for the .py version, in case of slow internet speeds.
